## Question 1:
The tree data CSV shows tree ID, stand ID, stand number, year, species, age, inc, and rad for each tree. This is set up as a table with trees for each row and characteristics of the tree in each column.
```{r}
glimpse(tree_dat)
```
## Question 2:
979 records have been made in stand 1. 
```{r}
filter(tree_dat, standID == 1)
```
## Question 3:
17,221 records of Abies balsamea and Pinus strobus species have been made. 
```{r}
filter(tree_dat, species == "ABBA" | species == "PIST")
```
## Question 4: 
There are 7 records of trees older than 200 years in the last year of the dataset. 
```{r}
filter(tree_dat, age > 200 & year == 2007)
```
## Question 5:
The oldest tree in the dataset is 269 years old and is a Pinus resinosa tree. Tree ID is 24.  
```{r}
slice_max(tree_dat, age)
```
## Question 6:
The five oldest trees recorded in 2001 are 263, 259, 212, and 206 years old. They are Pinus resinosa and Fraxinus nigra trees. Tree IDs are 24, 25, 1595, 1598, and 1712. 
```{r}
filter(tree_dat, age>200 & year == 2001)
```
## Question 7:
There are 687 trees in a 30% sample of those recorded in 2002.
```{r}
filter(tree_dat, year == 2002) %>% slice_sample(prop = 0.3)
```
## Question 8:
In descending order, the radius at breast height for the top three trees in stand 5 in 2007 are ID numbers 128, 157, and 135 with radii 239, 218, and 210. 
```{r}
filter(tree_dat, standID == 5 & year == 2007) %>% arrange(desc(rad_ib)) %>% slice_head(n = 3)
```
## Question 9:
```{r}
filter(tree_dat, grepl("3$", stand), year == 2007) %>% select(treeID, stand, year, rad_ib) %>% slice_min(order_by = rad_ib, n = 3)
```
## Question 10: 
```{r}
select(tree_dat, -stand) %>% glimpse()
```
## Question 11:
```{r}
select(tree_dat, matches("ID")) %>% glimpse()
```
## Question 12:
```{r}
select(tree_dat, matches("ID|stand")) %>% glimpse()
```
## Question 13:
```{r}
tree_dat <- tree_dat %>% rename(inc_mm = inc, rad_ib_mm = rad_ib) %>% glimpse()
```
## Question 14:
```{r}
mutate(tree_dat, rad_ib_cm = rad_ib_mm / 10, DBH = 2 * rad_ib_cm, BA = 0.00007854 * DBH^2) %>% filter(species == "POTR", year == 2007) %>% summarise(mean_BA = mean(BA, na.rm = TRUE))
```
## Question 15:
```{r}
mutate(tree_dat, established = if_else(age > 5, TRUE, FALSE)) %>% count(established)
```
## Question 16:
```{r}
tree_dat <- tree_dat %>% mutate(DBH_class = case_when(DBH >= 0 & DBH < 2.5 ~ "seedling",DBH >= 2.5 & DBH < 10 ~ "sapling", DBH >= 10 & DBH < 30 ~ "pole", DBH >= 30 ~ "sawlog", TRUE ~ NA_character_))
```

```{r}
filter(tree_dat, year == 2007) %>% count(DBH_class)
```
## Question 17:
```{r}
filter(tree_dat, year == 2007) %>% summarize(mean_DBH = mean(DBH), sd_DBH = sd(DBH))
```
These data show that the mean diameter at breast height for trees recorded in 2007 is ~16.1 cm and on average trees in this year will deviate from the mean by ~6.13 cm.

## Question 18:
```{r}
filter(tree_dat, year == 2003) %>% group_by(species) %>% summarize(mean_age = mean(age)) %>% arrange(desc(mean_age)) %>% slice_head(n = 3)
```
The three species with the oldest mean age are Thuja occidentalis, Fraxinus nigra, and Pinus strobus. 

## Question 19:
```{r}
summarize(tree_dat, num_unique_yrs = n_distinct(year), first_year = min(year), last_year = max(year))
```

## Question 20:
```{r}
group_by(tree_dat, stand) %>% summarize(num_unique_yrs = n_distinct(year)) %>% filter(num_unique_yrs == max(num_unique_yrs))
```

## Final Question:
```{r}
tree_dat %>% arrange(species, treeID, year) %>% group_by(species, treeID) %>% mutate(growth_per_year = DBH - lag(DBH), total_growth = DBH - first(DBH)) %>% filter(!is.na(growth_per_year)) %>% group_by(species) %>% summarize(avg_growth = mean(growth_per_year), sd_growth = sd(growth_per_year), total_growth_record = n_distinct(year)) %>% filter(total_growth_record >= 10) %>% arrange(desc(avg_growth)) %>% slice_head(n = 3)
```
```{r}
tree_dat %>% arrange(species, treeID, year) %>% group_by(species, treeID) %>% mutate(growth_per_year = DBH - lag(DBH), total_growth = DBH - first(DBH)) %>% filter(!is.na(growth_per_year)) %>% group_by(species) %>% summarize(avg_growth = mean(growth_per_year), sd_growth = sd(growth_per_year), total_growth_record = n_distinct(year)) %>% filter(total_growth_record >= 10) %>% arrange(avg_growth) %>% slice_head(n = 3)
```
The 3 species with the fastest growth are Pinus resinosa, Populus tremuloides, and Pinus banksiana. The 3 species with the slowest growth rate are Larix laricina, Thuja occidentalis, and Quercus rubra.
